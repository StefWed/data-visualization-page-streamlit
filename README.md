# Data Visualization Pages With Streamlit


#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to showcase different examples on using Streamlit to visualize data. Focus lies on combining the Python visualization library Plotly and Streamlit to create interactive data visualizations which can be used to explore and share data, to identify patterns, trends and outliers.

### Methods Used
* Data Cleaning, Data Transformation
* Data Visualization: creating plots and subplots using Plotly
* Data Visualization: creating geo plots using Plotly as well as additional geo information

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Plotly
* Streamlit

## Project Description
### Dogs in Zurich Example
A fun project using the official dog population in Zurich, with examples on how to add further information like in this case size of Zurich/ each Stadtkreis (borough) in square meters or human population. The oroginal data set was downloaded from the following page [Hundebestaende der Stadt Zuerich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/sid_stapo_hundebestand_od1001). Additional data sources are referenced within the respective notebook. 

The project starts with absolute numbers, change over the years 2015-2024 and displays them in line plots. Differences for each borough are shown using subplots.
